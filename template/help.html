    <h1>Help: Posts</h1>
    <p>A post represents a uploaded file that can be commented on and searched for. Alternatively if you upload a post of your own you can give it original poster and source attributes, as well as caption and add tags that can be easily searched for as before mentioned.</p>

    <h1>Help: Search</h1>
    <p>You can search for tag <b>game gtav</b> and it will search for Grand Theft Auto V gameplay posts. Because you put two tags together, alternatively if you don't want gameplay you can add <b>-game</b> tag with a minus sign in front of tag name instead and it will search for posts that depict GTA V instead of gameplay.</p>
    <p>When searching you might want to look at what tags are available, click <a href="{{ url_for('Tag.tag_page') }}">here</a></p>
